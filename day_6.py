# Functions : A function in its simplest form is just a wrapper name for a block of code.
# You give it name and then when you call the function by that name, all the code within the
# function block will be executed. It can help us save time and reduce repeated code.
# Eg:

print("Hello")
name_len = len("pooja")
print(name_len)
