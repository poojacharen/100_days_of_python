# Multiple If Statements

if <condition 1 is true>
    <do A>
if <condition 2 is true>
    <do B>
if <condition 3 is true>
    <do C>

# In the multiple if statements, A, B, and C can all happen. But they are completely independent of each other. 
# C can happen even if A and B don't. Every condition is checked, no matter the result of the others.
