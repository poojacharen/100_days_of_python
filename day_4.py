# Random Module
# Think of the random module in Python as a tool that helps a computer make choices
# that seem like guesses, kind of like rolling a dice or picking a card from a shuffled deck.

import random

# Random Whole Numbers within a range

random_integer = random.randint(1,10)
print(random_integer)
