# Loops allow us to tell the computer to repeat actions without having to write repeated code.
# If we wanted the computer to print out 1 through to 100, it would be very painful to type a print 
# statement for every number, or even just typing out all the numbers 1 through to 100. 
# Loops allow us to create a rule and the computer can follow it to do a repeated action.

# Syntax
# for <variable name of each item> in <a List>:
    # <do something>
    # <do something else>
