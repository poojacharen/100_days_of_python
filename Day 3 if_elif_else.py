# If/elif/else

if <condition 1 is true>
    <do A>
elif <condition 2 is true>
    <do B>
else
    <do C>

# In the if/elif/else block, only one of A, B, or C can happen, because if/elif/else are mutually exclusive. 
# The first condition has to fail to go into the elif and the elif (or multiple elif) have to fail to go into the else. Condition 2 is only checked if condition 1 is false.
