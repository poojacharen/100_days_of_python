# Nested if statements

if <condition 1 is true>
    <do A>
    if <condition 2 is true>
        <do B>
        if <condition 3 is true>
            <do C>

# In the nested if statements, A, B and C can all happen, but conditions 1, 2 and 3 must all be true. 
# The computer will only check condition 2 if condition 1 is true.
